# 🌲 Segment Tree - A Powerful Tool for Range Queries & Updates

A **Segment Tree** is a versatile data structure designed for scenarios where you need to:

- Perform **frequent queries** (like sum, min, max, gcd) over a **range** in an array.
- Make **point or range updates** efficiently.

## 📌 What is a Segment Tree?

Segment Tree is a **binary tree** where:

- Each node represents a **range or segment** of the original array.
- The tree helps answer queries and perform updates in `O(log n)` time.

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity

| Operation           | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Build               | `O(n)`          | `O(4n)`          |
| Point Update        | `O(log n)`      |                  |
| Range Update (Lazy) | `O(log n)`      |                  |
| Query (Sum/Min/Max) | `O(log n)`      |                  |
